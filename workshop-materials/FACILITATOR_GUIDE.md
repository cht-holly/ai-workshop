- [ ] `sample-data/equity_prices.csv` - Sample dataset
- [ ] This facilitator guide

## Phase-by-Phase Guidance

### Phase 1: Requirements & Planning (10 min)
**Objective**: Teach structured requirement gathering with AI

**Key Teaching Points**:
- Demonstrate the STAR method for prompts
- Show how to ask AI for multiple perspectives
- Emphasize specificity over vagueness

**Common Pitfalls to Address**:
- Participants asking "build me a dashboard" without context
- Skipping the planning phase to jump into coding
- Not validating AI suggestions against requirements

**Facilitator Actions**:
- Walk through first prompt example on screen
- Show how good prompts lead to better planning
- Encourage questions about AI responses

### Phase 2: Environment Setup (10 min)
**Objective**: Systematic project initialization

**Key Teaching Points**:
- AI can help with boilerplate but needs guidance
- Importance of validating AI-generated configurations
- Building context for future interactions

**Watch For**:
- Participants not checking generated requirements.txt
- Skipping data validation steps
- Assuming AI knows their local environment

**Facilitator Actions**:
- Demonstrate dependency checking
- Show how to catch AI mistakes early
- Emphasize the value of incremental validation

### Phase 3: Core Implementation (25 min)
**Objective**: Iterative development with AI partnership

**Key Teaching Points**:
- Break complex features into smaller steps
- Use AI for code review and suggestions
- Build context progressively

**Three Sub-Phases**:
1. **Basic Dashboard** (8 min): Simple chart + dropdown
2. **Interactive Features** (10 min): Filtering, multiple views
3. **Advanced Analytics** (7 min): Calculations, metrics

**Facilitator Actions**:
- Circulate and help with prompt refinement
- Point out effective AI interactions
- Address technical issues quickly

**Common Issues**:
- AI generating overly complex solutions
- Participants not testing incrementally
- Copying code without understanding

### Phase 4: Enhancement & Testing (10 min)
**Objective**: Quality assurance and refinement

**Key Teaching Points**:
- AI can help identify edge cases
- Importance of error handling
- Performance considerations

**Focus Areas**:
- Error handling strategies
- Code review with AI
- Testing approaches

### Phase 5: Deployment & Documentation (5 min)
**Objective**: Production readiness

**Key Teaching Points**:
- AI as documentation assistant
- Deployment preparation
- Final review processes

## Facilitation Tips

### Encouraging Good Practices
- **Celebrate effective prompts**: When someone uses the STAR method well
- **Share discoveries**: Have participants share interesting AI responses
- **Iterate publicly**: Show how to refine prompts based on results

### Managing Common Challenges
- **AI gives wrong answer**: Use as teaching moment about validation
- **Participant falls behind**: Pair with ahead participant
- **Technical issues**: Have backup environments ready

### Time Management
- **Phase 1-2**: Keep moving, don't get stuck in planning
- **Phase 3**: This is the core - give most attention here
- **Phase 4-5**: Can be compressed if needed

## Key Messages to Reinforce

1. **AI is a collaborative partner, not a magic wand**
2. **Good prompts require domain knowledge and clear thinking**
3. **Always validate and understand AI-generated code**
4. **Iteration and refinement are key to success**
5. **Context building makes AI more effective over time**

## Workshop Wrap-Up

### Debrief Questions (5 min)
- What was the most effective prompt you used?
- When did AI exceed your expectations?
- What would you do differently next time?
- How will you apply this in your daily work?

### Next Steps
- Share additional resources for AI-assisted development
- Encourage experimentation with different prompt styles
- Suggest follow-up projects to practice these skills

## Success Indicators

**Participants are succeeding if they**:
- Ask follow-up questions to refine AI responses
- Catch and correct AI mistakes
- Build on AI suggestions rather than just accepting them
- Use specific, contextual prompts

**Red flags to address**:
- Copying code without understanding
- Giving up when AI makes mistakes
- Using overly vague prompts
- Not testing AI-generated solutions

## Post-Workshop Follow-Up

### Collect Feedback
- What worked well in the workshop structure?
- Which prompts were most/least effective?
- What would improve the learning experience?

### Share Resources
- Link to extended prompt libraries
- Advanced AI development techniques
- Community resources for continued learning
