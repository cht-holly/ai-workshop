# AI-Powered Development Workshop

Learn to build applications using agentic AI through a structured, iterative approach that mirrors professional software development practices.

## Workshop Overview

This workshop teaches the **AI Development Workflow**:
1. **User Stories** → Define what you want to build
2. **Implementation Plan** → Break down the approach  
3. **Implementation** → Build with AI assistance
4. **Verification** → Test and refine

You'll build a **Stock Price Dashboard** that visualizes equity data with moving averages, demonstrating how to collaborate effectively with AI agents.

## What You'll Build

An interactive dashboard featuring:
- Stock price visualization for NVDA, AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT (one month of data)
- 7-day simple moving average overlay
- Date range filtering (analyze different time periods)
- Summary statistics and performance metrics
- Professional, responsive interface

## Required Tools

- **GitHub Copilot Agent Mode** (VS Code extension)
- **VS Code** (latest version)
- **Python 3.8+** with pip
- **Sample data**: `sample-data/equity_prices.csv` (provided)

## How to Use This Workshop

### For Self-Guided Learning:
1. Start with `steps/step-00-setup.md`
2. Follow each step in sequence (00 → 08)
3. Copy prompts into your AI agent
4. Build incrementally, verifying each step
5. Compare your results with expected outcomes
6. The AI will maintain a CHANGELOG.md to track progress

### For Facilitators:
1. Review `workshop-materials/FACILITATOR_GUIDE.md`
2. Use the step-by-step structure for guided instruction
3. Each step includes: Context → Prompt → Expected Result → Verification

### Workshop Structure:

**Step 0: Setup (2 min)**
- Create app/ folder for development

**Steps 1-2: Planning Phase (15 min)**
- Define user stories and requirements
- Create implementation roadmap

**Steps 3-4: Foundation (15 min)**  
- Set up environment and load data
- Create basic dashboard structure

**Steps 5-6: Core Features (20 min)**
- Add interactive stock selection
- Implement moving average calculations

**Steps 7-8: Enhancement (10 min)**
- Add date filtering and statistics
- Polish and finalize

## Key Learning Outcomes

1. **Structured Prompting**: How to break complex tasks into clear, actionable requests
2. **Iterative Development**: Build incrementally with continuous verification
3. **Context Building**: Provide relevant information to improve AI responses
4. **AI Collaboration**: Treat AI as a development partner, not just a code generator

## The AI Development Workflow

### 1. User Stories
```
As a [user], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]
```
Start every feature with clear user stories that define value and purpose.

### 2. Implementation Plan  
```
Break down the user story into:
- Technical requirements
- Component architecture  
- Development steps
```

### 3. Implementation
```
Build incrementally:
- Start with basic functionality
- Add complexity gradually
- Test each addition
```

### 4. Verification
```
After each step:
- Test the functionality
- Compare with requirements
- Refine based on results
```

## Success Metrics

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:
- Structure AI prompts for complex development tasks
- Guide an AI agent through a complete development lifecycle  
- Iterate effectively with AI feedback
- Build confidence in AI-assisted development

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have all required tools installed
2. Clone or download this workshop repository
3. Start with `steps/step-01-user-stories.md`
4. Follow the prompts in your AI agent
5. Build your dashboard step by step!
