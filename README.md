You're helping me design a 1-hour interactive workshop to teach developers how to use GitHub Copilot Agent Mode effectively.

The structure of the workshop is hands-on: participants will use Copilot Agent Mode to build a minimal data dashboard in Python using Dash, starting from a CSV containing equity prices (Date, Ticker, Close) for NVDA, AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT.

The agent will be their assistant throughout — creating the environment, transforming the data, and building the dashboard step by step.

Please generate a `WORKSHOP_PLAN.md` (or `README.md`) that includes:

1. The goal of the workshop
2. What participants will build during the session
3. Required tools (e.g. GitHub Copilot Agent Mode, VS Code, Python)
4. A high-level outline of the flow (setup → data load → transform → dashboard → polish)
5. Key learning outcomes (e.g. prompt chaining, using context effectively, iterative refinement)
6. Guidelines for structuring agent prompts (with 1–2 examples)
7. A suggested folder layout (but actual scaffolding will be done by the agent)

This should be written as if you are preparing the session for other instructors or participants to read. Don’t generate any actual Python code — just the workshop structure and prompt philosophy.

Keep it concise, clear, and encouraging.
