# Step 3: Project Setup

**Duration**: 5 minutes  
**Workflow Phase**: Implementation  
**Goal**: Create organized project structure and install dependencies

## Context

You have a clear plan. Now it's time to set up your development environment. This step creates the foundation for your dashboard development.

## The Prompt

Copy this prompt into your AI agent:

```
Set up the project environment for our stock dashboard.

Required Dependencies:
- dash (for web framework)
- plotly (for charting)
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- numpy (for numerical operations)

Project Requirements:
- Clean, organized project structure suitable for dashboard development
- All necessary dependencies available for development
- Basic application entry point ready for development
- Proper directory structure for components and utilities

Tasks:
1. Create a logical project directory structure
2. Generate requirements.txt with the specified dependencies
3. Create main application file with basic Dash setup
4. Set up any necessary utility and component directories

The result should be a project ready for immediate dashboard development.
```

## Expected Result

You should have:
- **Project structure**: Organized directories for code, data, tests
- **requirements.txt**: With dash, plotly, pandas, numpy dependencies
- **app.py**: Basic Dash application setup
- **Supporting directories**: For components, utilities, etc.

## Verification

âœ… **Check your results:**
- Is there a clear project directory structure?
- Does requirements.txt include all required dependencies?
- Is there a main app.py file with basic Dash setup?
- Are there directories for organizing code (components, utils, etc.)?
- Can you run `pip install -r requirements.txt` successfully?

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create the project structure** as suggested by your AI agent
2. **Install dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Test basic setup**: Run the app.py file to ensure Dash starts correctly
4. **Verify**: Check that you can access the basic dashboard in your browser

## Next Step

With your project set up, proceed to **Step 4: Data Loading** to connect your CSV data.
