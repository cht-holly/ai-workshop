# Step 3: Project Setup

**Duration**: 5 minutes  
**Workflow Phase**: Implementation  
**Goal**: Create organized project structure and install dependencies

## Context

You have a clear plan. Now it's time to set up your development environment. This step creates the foundation for your dashboard development.

## The Prompt

Copy this prompt into your AI agent:

```
Set up the dashboard project structure inside the app/ folder and get the app running.

Context:
- I'm working in a workshop repository with an app/ folder for development
- All dashboard files should be created inside the app/ directory
- I want to get a basic Dash app running that will auto-reload when I make changes

Required Dependencies:
- dash (for web framework)
- plotly (for charting)
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- numpy (for numerical operations)

Tasks:
1. Set up a Python virtual environment in the main directory (not inside app/)
2. Create app/requirements.txt with the specified dependencies
3. Create app/app.py with a basic Dash setup that includes debug=True for auto-reload
4. Provide instructions to activate the virtual environment and install dependencies
5. Make sure the app runs and auto-reloads when files change

The goal is to have a running Dash app that automatically refreshes when you make changes to the code.

Documentation:
Update the CHANGELOG.md file to track this step. Include:
- Virtual environment and dependencies setup
- Basic running app created
- Auto-reload functionality enabled
- Next steps planned
```

## Expected Result

You should have:
- **Virtual environment**: Activated Python environment
- **app/app.py**: Main Dash application file with debug=True
- **app/requirements.txt**: With dash, plotly, pandas, numpy dependencies  
- **Running application**: Basic Dash app at localhost:8050 with auto-reload

## Verification

âœ… **Check your results:**
- Is the virtual environment activated?
- Is there an app/app.py file with basic Dash setup and debug=True?
- Is there an app/requirements.txt with all required dependencies?
- Can you run `pip install -r app/requirements.txt` successfully?
- Does the app start and show "Hello World" at localhost:8050?
- Does the app auto-reload when you make changes to app/app.py?

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up virtual environment** as suggested by your AI agent
2. **Activate the environment** and install dependencies with `pip install -r app/requirements.txt`
3. **Start the app**: Run `python app/app.py` 
4. **Verify auto-reload**: Open localhost:8050, then modify app/app.py and save to see if it refreshes
5. **Keep it running**: Leave the app running for the remaining steps

## Next Step

With your project set up, proceed to **Step 4: Data Loading** to connect your CSV data.
