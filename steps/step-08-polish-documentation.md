- Overview of features and functionality

Required Information:
1. How to install dependencies
2. How to run the dashboard locally
3. What features are available
4. Brief explanation of the moving average methodology
5. How to interpret the results

Keep documentation practical and focused on getting the dashboard running. The goal is to help someone else quickly understand and use the project.

Documentation:
Update the CHANGELOG.md file to track this final step. Include:
- What was accomplished (final polish and documentation)
- Visual improvements made
- Documentation created
- Overall project completion status
- Summary of the complete dashboard functionality

This provides a complete record of the development process.
```
