# Step 0: Workshop Setup

**Duration**: 1 minute  
**Workflow Phase**: Foundation  
**Goal**: Create app/ folder for all dashboard development

## Context

Before starting development, you need to create a dedicated `app/` folder where all your dashboard code will live. This keeps your development work organized and separate from the workshop materials.

## The Prompt

Copy this prompt into your AI agent:

```
Create an app/ folder for dashboard development.

Context:
- I'm following a workshop to build a stock price dashboard
- I need a dedicated folder for all development work
- All subsequent steps will create files inside this app/ folder

Task:
Create an empty 'app/' directory in the current workspace.

This folder will be used for all dashboard development in the following steps.

Documentation:
Create or update a CHANGELOG.md file to track this step. Include:
- What was accomplished in this step
- Files created or modified
- Next steps planned

This changelog will help maintain context throughout the workshop.
```

## Expected Result

You should have:
- **app/ folder**: Empty directory ready for development
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Documentation of this step

## Verification

âœ… **Check your results:**
- Is there a new `app/` folder in your workspace?
- Is the folder empty and ready for development?
- Is there a CHANGELOG.md file documenting this step?

## Important Note

**All remaining workshop steps (Steps 1-8) will create files inside the `app/` folder.** This keeps your dashboard code organized and separate from the workshop materials.

## Next Step

With your app/ folder ready, proceed to **Step 1: User Stories** to begin defining your dashboard requirements.
