# Step 2: Create Implementation Plan

**Duration**: 10 minutes  
**Workflow Phase**: Implementation Plan  
**Goal**: Break down user stories into technical approach and development steps

## Context

You have user stories defining what to build. Now you need to plan how to build it. This step transforms user requirements into a technical roadmap that guides your development process.

## The Prompt

Copy this prompt into your AI agent:

```
Based on the user stories from Step 1, create a technical implementation plan for the stock dashboard.

Project Requirements:
- Interactive web dashboard showing stock price trends
- 7-day simple moving average overlay calculated using pandas rolling window method
- Date range filtering and stock selection controls
- Summary statistics panel showing key metrics
- Professional, responsive interface

Technology Constraints:
- Use Python with Dash framework for web interface
- Use Plotly for charting
- Use Pandas for data manipulation
- Data source: CSV file with Date, Ticker, Close columns
- SMA calculation: Use pandas rolling(window=7).mean() method

Create a plan covering:
1. System architecture overview (how components connect)
2. Development phases with specific milestones
3. Technical approach for key features (moving average, filtering, etc.)
4. Component breakdown (main building blocks needed)

Focus on creating a clear roadmap that any developer could follow to build this dashboard.
```

## Expected Result

You should receive a structured plan including:
- **Architecture**: Data flow from CSV → Processing → Visualization → UI
- **Development Phases**: Logical sequence of implementation steps
- **Technical Approach**: Specific methods for calculations and interactions
- **Components**: Key building blocks (data loader, chart renderer, etc.)

## Verification

✅ **Check your results:**
- Is there a clear system architecture showing how components connect?
- Are development phases in logical order (foundation → features → polish)?
- Is the moving average calculation approach specified (pandas rolling)?
- Are the main components identified (data, charts, controls, etc.)?
- Could another developer follow this plan to build the dashboard?

## Next Step

With your implementation plan ready, proceed to **Step 3: Project Setup** to create the development environment.
